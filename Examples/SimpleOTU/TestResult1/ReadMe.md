- C.ij.bray: Cij represent the observed similarity (ranging from 0 to 1) between the ith community and the jth community (i,j ∈{1, …,m}). If a similarity metric does not range from 0 to 1, it can be standardized (SI Appendix, Supplementary Text A).
- E.ij.bray: Eij represent the randomly expected similarity between the ith community and the jth community after randomization of the metacommunity, which is repeated for 1,000 times to generate a set of null expected communities.
- ST.ij.bray: Stochasticity Ratio (not normalized)
- NST.ij.bray: Normalized Stochasticity Ratio
- MST.ij.bray: Modified Stochasticity Ratio (a special form of Normalized Stochasticity Ratio)
